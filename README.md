# Pakistan Universities Data Analysis with Power BI üìä

This repository hosts an extensive **Power BI** data analysis project on **higher education institutions in Pakistan**. The data is categorized by **province**, **campus locations**, **cities**, and **fields of study** to provide insights into Pakistan‚Äôs academic landscape from 2020 to 2024. This analysis helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve educational accessibility and resource allocation across the country.

## üìë Project Overview

Our **Pakistan Universities Data Analysis** project explores:
- **Province-based Distribution**: Overview of universities managed by different provincial governments (AJK, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Sindh).
- **Campus Location Data**: Breakdown of campuses by city, including major hubs like Karachi, Lahore, Multan, and Swat.
- **Field of Study Categories**: Analysis of study categories such as General, Arts & Design, Agriculture, Engineering, and Medical.
- **Annual Trends**: Yearly comparison from 2020 to 2024 to identify trends and shifts in higher education.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Visualize the Distribution of Universities** across Pakistan‚Äôs provinces.
- **Identify Trends in Campus Growth** and shifts in educational resources by field of study.
- **Support Policy Makers and Educators** by providing a clear picture of the educational infrastructure.

## üìä Data Visualizations and Key Insights

Using **Power BI Desktop**, the following insights were generated:
1. **Province-Wise Breakdown**: Highlights the total number of universities and categorizes them by provincial oversight.
2. **City-Level Analysis**: Concentration of campuses in key cities, illustrating urban education hubs.
3. **Field-Specific Data**: Distribution by study category, which helps in understanding academic priorities across regions.
4. **Year-by-Year Trends (2020-2024)**: Visualizes growth patterns, allowing stakeholders to analyze expansion and retraction in various educational sectors.
